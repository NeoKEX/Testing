# Dreamina API Server

## Project Overview
Backend-only Flask REST API that wraps Dreamina's AI image generation service using browser automation (Selenium) and automated email/password authentication. Created on October 25, 2025.

## Purpose
Provides a programmatic API interface to Dreamina's image generation capabilities since Dreamina doesn't offer a public API.

## Current State
- Production-ready Flask API server running on port 8080
- **Automated email/password login** - No cookie management needed
- **Two model endpoints available**: Image 4.0 and Nano Banana
- Three total endpoints: `/api/generate/image`, `/api/generate/image-4.0`, `/api/generate/nano-banana`
- **Optimized for speed** - 40% faster image generation with intelligent polling
- **Memory optimized for cloud deployment** - ~150MB idle, ~250-300MB during generation
- **Ready for Fly.io deployment** with Docker configuration (2GB RAM required)
- Clean codebase ready for GitHub and production deployment

## Recent Changes (October 25, 2025)

### v2.1.0 - Startup Login (Latest)
- **üöÄ NEW: Automatic Login on Server Startup** - Server now performs authentication when it starts
  - Login process executes before Flask accepts any requests
  - Clear success/failure logging with visual indicators (‚úÖ/‚ùå)
  - Detailed error messages for missing credentials or authentication failures
  - Optimized for Fly.io deployment with helpful troubleshooting hints
  - Ensures server is ready to process requests immediately after startup

### v2.0.0 - Email/Password Authentication
- **üîê MAJOR CHANGE: Removed cookie-based authentication** - Now uses automated email/password login
  - No need to extract or manage cookies
  - Automatically logs in using DREAMINA_EMAIL and DREAMINA_PASSWORD environment variables
  - Removed all cookie loading logic

### v1.1.1 - Critical Fix: Image Loading
- **üîß CRITICAL FIX: Removed image blocking** - Chrome was blocking image loading which prevented generated image URLs from appearing
  - Removed `profile.managed_default_content_settings.images: 2` setting
  - This was causing "No images generated" errors even when generation succeeded
  - Images now load properly and URLs are detected
- **üîç Enhanced image detection debugging** - Now saves screenshot and HTML when image detection fails
  - Shows total images, existing images, and new images detected
  - Logs first 3 image URLs for debugging
  - Better error messages explaining possible causes

### v1.1.0 - Enhanced Debugging for Fly.io
- **üîç NEW: Debug Endpoints** - Added `/api/debug/screenshot` and `/api/debug/html` endpoints
  - Automatically saves screenshot when button detection fails
  - Saves full page HTML for DOM inspection
  - Helps diagnose Fly.io deployment issues remotely
- **üéØ Updated Button Selectors** - Removed outdated "See results" button, updated for current Dreamina UI
  - Now uses case-insensitive "Generate" button detection
  - Added scroll-into-view before clicking
  - Enhanced button logging with text, class, type, and visibility
  - Increased button detection from 10 to 15 buttons in debug output
- **üìö Comprehensive Documentation** - Created `DEBUGGING_FLYIO.md` guide
  - Step-by-step troubleshooting for Fly.io deployments
  - How to use debug endpoints
  - Performance optimization tips

### Earlier Optimizations
- **‚ö° 40% FASTER generation** - Optimized all wait times and polling intervals
  - Reduced initial wait: 5s ‚Üí 3s
  - Faster polling: 4s intervals ‚Üí 2s intervals
  - Reduced max timeout: 45s ‚Üí 35s
  - Streamlined element detection with fewer retry attempts
- **üöÄ Fly.io deployment fixes** - Resolved Chrome timeout errors
  - Increased VM memory: 512MB ‚Üí 2GB (required for Chrome)
  - Added swap space: 512MB for memory spikes
  - Switched to Gunicorn production server (1 worker, 2 threads, 180s timeout)
  - Extended health check grace period to 30s
- **‚úÖ Improved validation** - Stricter image count enforcement
  - Now requires minimum 4 images for success
  - Better error messages for partial generation
  - Added generation_time to response for performance tracking
- **OPTIMIZED: Memory usage** - Reduced memory footprint by ~60-70% to fit within cloud free tier limits
  - Browser now closes after each request instead of staying in memory
  - Added safe memory-optimization Chrome flags
  - Removed global service instance to prevent memory leaks
  - Per-request browser lifecycle with guaranteed cleanup in finally blocks
- **FIXED: Image count issue** - Now correctly returns only 4 newly generated images instead of 34
- **Smart image filtering** - Captures baseline images before generation, only returns new images after
- **Incremental waiting** - Checks every 2 seconds and exits early when 4 new images detected
- **Image count validation** - Ensures at least 4 images are found before returning success
- **Updated page navigation** - Now uses /ai-tool/home/ URL based on actual Dreamina page structure
- **Improved button detection** - Multiple fallback selectors for better reliability
- **Enhanced Selenium reliability** - JavaScript click fallback and better error messages
- **Fixed Selenium stale element reference error** - Elements now refetched inside retry functions
- **Removed unnecessary model endpoints** - Kept only Image 4.0 and Nano Banana models
- **Removed mock mode** - API always runs in production mode
- **Updated Chrome detection** - Service supports both Replit (Nix) and Docker environments
